allows for the adding and removing of additional ink and discordant

----how to use----

in game press - to open the menu to add any ink
going into or out of a run removes all pages(which the extra inks are) so you have to add them after entering a run
keep in mind that discordant alters how secondary inks work

----disclaimer----

multiplayer does work for now, however pages are public to everyone in the lobby and if you abuse this in lobbies with people who dont want you using this mod you are liable to be banned, ALWAYS ask for permission from everyone you are playing with before using this mod.
